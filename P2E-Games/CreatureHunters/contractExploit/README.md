# Exploit Code for the LaunchpadNFT Smart Contract of Creature Hunters

This smart contract have a vulnerability which allows anyone to buy new NFTs with any valid BEP20 Token.

This occurs because the function `buyNFT` doesn't check if the address passed on the parameter `_dealToken` is the same on the `_launch.dealToken`.
